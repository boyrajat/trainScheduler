# trainScheduler
Week 7 homework

Hello !!

Choo Choo Train scheduler has the first 4 records updated live from UK's Transport Api for trains arriving at Euston Station.

The times under "Expected arrival times" is in UK time zone however the minutes to arrival has been converted to show as per current US Easter time zone using Moment.js. So you will know the minutes left for the train to arrive in real time.

Minutes to arrive for all trains automatically update every 60 seconds. In addition to that the auto updated UK trains information also updates every 60 seconds.

You are not able to delete these 4 trains on the top of the table as they are updated live.

You may add or remove train information of your choice below.

The Expected arrival time must be in HH:MM military time format or the form will alert you and will not submit the data.

Hope you enjoy this application !!
